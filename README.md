Data analysis and visualization of greenhouse gas emissions of parties of climate change convention

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCC) aims to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in this project, I aim to present the status of emissions from countries that are parties to this convention.

To curb the emissions, we need to have an idea of top emissions and emitters of these top emissions. To make this possible we will start with cleaning and classifying the data to suit our visualization needs, perform analysis on emissions, country wise and gas wise, visualize and make the visualizations be available on an easy to access user interface using the shiny app in R, which would enable easy access to people and hence provide better understanding of the emission trend.
